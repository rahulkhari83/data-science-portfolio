# Customer Churn Analysis (Python)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end Data Science workflow to predict customer churn using Python and machine learning techniques.

## Objective
The goal is to analyze customer behavior and predict whether a customer is likely to leave (churn) based on features such as contract type, monthly charges, support calls, and payment history.

## Dataset
- File: data/customer_churn.csv
- Type: Synthetic dataset generated for portfolio use
- Purpose: Simulates real-world customer behavior while avoiding privacy issues

## Workflow
1. Data loading using Pandas
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data preprocessing using one-hot encoding
4. Machine learning model: Logistic Regression
5. Model evaluation using:
   - Classification report
   - Confusion matrix
   - ROC-AUC score

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Outcome
The project identifies key factors influencing customer churn and demonstrates how machine learning can support business decision-making.
